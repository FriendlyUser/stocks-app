# Stock notification app

Built on google cloud run and C#, might for me to know how to deploy to google cloud run and learn C#.

Prefer to use command line, not the one embeeded inside vs code.

Mainly charts using chartjs and fred data.


```
dotnet build
```


```
dotnet build -o app
dotnet run app
```
Mainly used to learn how razor works and how to fetch data from various apis.


## Lessons Learned

- Blazor Server is just a regular C# server, this allows you to setup api endpoints using standard ASP.NET
- Google cloud run can pretty much deploy any containized application
- IexApi (insert after done)


## Todolist

* https://github.com/DarkMatterOregon/blazor-server-api-example/commit/d9bd9d73a2104d2f092c26d00fa05ba127b75e42
* Move some of the functions to a new controller folder and make an api folder.
