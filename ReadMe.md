# Stock notification app

Built on google cloud run and C#, might for me to know how to deploy to google cloud run and learn C#.

Prefer to use command line, not the one embeeded inside vs code.

Mainly charts using chartjs and fred data.

```
dotnet build
```

Mainly used to learn how razor works and how to fetch data from various apis.
